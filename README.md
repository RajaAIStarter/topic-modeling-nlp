# topic-modeling-nlp

Topic modeling is a powerful unsupervised technique in natural language processing (NLP) that automatically discovers the hidden thematic structure in large collections of text. By “mining” the co-occurrence patterns of words across documents, topic models extract groups of words—called topics—that represent abstract themes running through the corpus. This Repository has explanation of the core concepts, popular methods, and practical details of topic modeling.
